# Venture Funding with Deep Learning- Startup success forecaster
Create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Technologies

import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
import hvplot.pandas
---

## Installation Guide
run program using jupyterlab

---

## Usage
Predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful,create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.




* Step 1: Preprocess data for a neural network model.

* Step 2: Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

* Step 3: Optimize the model.
